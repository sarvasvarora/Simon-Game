# Simon-Game
## Play here: https://sarvasvarora.me/simon-game
## Recreated the popular Simon game using JavaScript. 

- User can choose to enable/disable strict mode. With strict mode on, if the user plays a wrong move, the game will automatically restart from level one. However, without strict mode, only the current level would restart.
- User can also select the number of levels required to win the game. 
- More rules on the game page.
